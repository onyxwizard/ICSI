# ICSI CNSS – Certified Network Security Specialist

## What is ICSI CNSS?
This course by the International Cybersecurity Institute – Certified Network Security Specialist a.k.a ICSI CNSS provides a detailed overview of modern network security including operating system hardening, firewalls, intrusion-detection systems, VPNs, and Encryption. The course also includes topics such as physical security standards, system security, and security policies.

I have finally completed the 13 modules of the course. It took me a long time to complete because of a busy schedule, but this course can be completed easily within 2 months.

The course structure was brilliantly designed for basic to intermediate learners and the contents were good too. There were a few quizzes we had to pass before we get a certificate. The term Certificate of Attendance” bothers me a lot, as I have given an exam after each module to get this certificate, it should have mentioned “Certificate of Completion” but nevermind.
